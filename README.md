# Spiderly
Spiderly is a .NET (C#) code generation library that transforms an EF Core model into a fully customizable .NET (C#) + Angular web application, automatically updating all repetitive boilerplate code as your model evolves.

## Key Generation Features
- **CRUD Generator**  
  For each EF Core entity, the generator creates:
  - CRUD UI  
  - Angular API client  
  - .NET controllers  
  - Service methods to interact with the database

- **CRUD UI Generator**  
  For each EF Core entity, the generator creates:
  - A table view page — displays records with sorting, filtering, and pagination  
  - An admin page — a form for creating and editing records

- **API Client Generator**  
  Generates an Angular service class with methods that match your .NET controllers. Each method corresponds to a controller action and includes strongly typed parameters and responses based on your DTO classes.

- **Shared .NET and Angular Validations**  
  Generates .NET FluentValidation rules and matching Angular reactive form validators. Both sides stay in sync while allowing separate customization if needed.

- **C# DTO and TypeScript Classes**  
  Generates C# partial DTO classes and matching Angular TypeScript classes with strongly typed constructors.

- **.NET + Angular App Starter**  
  Sets up the .NET (C#) and Angular app template with built-in support for: authentication (including Google Sign-In), authorization, emailing, logging, global error handling, and more.

## Installation
Follow [Getting Started guide](https://www.spiderly.dev/docs/getting-started) to start using Spiderly.

## Examples
With the [Playground](https://www.spiderly.dev/playground) on the [Spiderly Website](https://www.spiderly.dev), you can create your own examples, live. Here is the first one to get you started:
```csharp
[TranslatePluralEn("Users")]
public class User
{
    [Required]
    public long Id { get; set; }

    [DisplayName]
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [UIControlWidth("col-12")]
    public Gender Gender { get; set; }

    [UIControlType("File")]
    public string Logo { get; set; }
}
```
```csharp
[TranslatePluralEn("Genders")]
public class Gender
{
    [Required]
    public long Id { get; set; }

    [DisplayName]
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
These two classes alone will generate app like this:

### Spiderly.CLI
By using the [Spiderly.CLI](https://github.com/filiptrivan/spiderly/tree/main/Spiderly.CLI), you properly initialize the app, allowing all other Spiderly libraries to function.

### Spiderly.SourceGenerators
[Spiderly.SourceGenerators](https://github.com/filiptrivan/spiderly/tree/main/Spiderly.SourceGenerators) generates a lot of features for both .NET and Angular apps by using attributes on EF Core entities. Its goal is to let developers focus solely on writing specific logic, without worrying about boilerplate code.

### Spiderly.Security
[Spiderly.Security](https://github.com/filiptrivan/spiderly/tree/main/Spiderly.Security) provides authentication and authorization features with JWT.

### Spiderly.Infrastructure
[Spiderly.Infrastructure](https://github.com/filiptrivan/spiderly/tree/main/Spiderly.Infrastructure) is built on EF Core and offers features such as optimistic concurrency control, customizable table and column naming, and extensions for simplified database configuration.

### Spiderly.Shared
[Spiderly.Shared](https://github.com/filiptrivan/spiderly/tree/main/Spiderly.Shared) provides shared features that can be used by all other Spiderly libraries.

### Getting Started as a Contributor
To set up your development environment for contributing to Spiderly, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Working Directory**
   - Select a location on your local machine where you want to store the project files. For example, you might choose: `C:\Users\your-name\Documents`
2. **Clone the Spiderly Repository**
   - Open your terminal or Git Bash and run: 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/filiptrivan/spiderly.git
     ```
3. **Install Angular Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the Angular project folder:
     ```bash
     cd spiderly/Angular
     ```
   - Install the required npm packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
4. **Install the Global Spiderly CLI Tool**
   - Run the `spiderly\Spiderly.CLI\cli-local-pack.ps1` PowerShell script.
5. **Initialize a New Spiderly Test App in Development Mode**
    - This step creates a new test application that will serve as a sandbox environment for testing and developing the Spiderly library. It allows you to see changes in real time as you work on the core library.
    - Run the following command in your working directory (`C:\Users\your-name\Documents`):
      ```bash
      spiderly init --dev
      ```
6. **Finish Setting Up the Spiderly Test App**
   - Start from step 4 of the official [Spiderly getting started guide](https://www.spiderly.dev/docs/getting-started), as the previous steps have already been completed.

Any changes made to the Spiderly source code will now be reflected in your newly created Spiderly test app. You shouldn't manually build or start the Spiderly library—changes will automatically reflect in the test app each time you save a file.

You’re all set! If you run into any issues during setup, feel free to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/filiptrivan/spiderly/issues/new). A [maintainer](https://github.com/filiptrivan) will respond as soon as possible, your feedback helps improve the experience for future contributors!

#### Developing and Testing `Spiderly.CLI`
If you want to make changes to the `Spiderly.CLI` project and test them immediately, run the PowerShell script `cli-local-pack.ps1` located in that project. You’ll need to execute this script each time you want to test your changes.

### Good First Issues
